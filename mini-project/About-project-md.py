## Features  
The Library Management System will include the following features:

1. Book Management  
   - Add new books to the library database.  
   - Update and delete existing book records.  
   - Search for books by title, author, or genre.

2. Member Management 
   - Register new library members with their details.  
   - Update and delete member records.  
   - View member details and borrowing history.

3. Borrowing and Returning  
   - Issue books to members and update due dates.  
   - Mark books as returned and calculate any applicable fines.  
   - Keep track of borrowed books and their status.

4. Search Functionality  
   - Search for books and members using filters and keywords.  

5. Reporting  
   - Generate reports such as the list of borrowed books, overdue books, and active members.

Expected Outcomes 
By the end of this project, the Library Management System will:  
1. Automate manual processes, saving time for library staff.  
2. Provide an organized and efficient way to manage library operations.  
3. Ensure data accuracy and prevent the loss of information.  
4. Enhance the user experience for library members through an easy-to-use interface.
